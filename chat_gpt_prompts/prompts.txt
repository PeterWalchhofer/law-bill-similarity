You are computing semantic text similarity. 
I will paste 6 pairs of text and you have to decide how similar a pair is. 
1 is complete semantic similarity and 0 no semantic similarity. Give reasons for each of you judgments.
Format the result in JSON (pair, score, reason).
Pairs:
(We prefer economic growth over environmental protection, We prefer climate change mitigation over economic performance)
(We prefer environmental protection over economic growth, We prefer climate change mitigation over economic performance)
(We prefer environmental protection over economic growth, We prefer economic performance over climate change mitigation)
(We prefer economic growth over environmental protection, We prefer economic performance over climate change mitigation)
(We prefer environmental protection over economic growth, We prefer economic growth over environmental protection)
(We prefer climate change mitigation over economic performance, We prefer economic performance over climate change mitigation)
